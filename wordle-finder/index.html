            This tool helps narrow the possible words you can choose for Wordle.
            To start Wordle, you need a word to start with.
            The <strong>Random start word</strong> section helps give you a start word with non-repeating letters.
          </p>
          <img src="random-words.png" alt="How to generate random words."/>
          <p>
            If you want to exclude previous answers, selecting <strong>Exclude previous answers</strong> will filter answers from the random word generation as well as the matches from submitting the form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you know the results of your first guess, you can input the letters you know are correct into the include section.

            Letters you don't want should be added to the exclude section.
          </p>
          <img src="include-exclude.png" alt="How to include and exclude letters."/>

          <p>
            If you know correct letters, and you know the right spot they should be in,
            add the letter to the correct spot in the <strong>Include in these spots</strong> section.

            If you know correct letters, and know the incorrect spots they are in,
            simply add the letters to the <strong>Ignore in these spots</strong> section.

            Once you are done, click submit.
          </p>
          <img src="spots.png" alt="How to narrow results of a particular spot."/>

          <p>
            All matches will be shown after clicking <strong>Submit</strong>.
            Statistics for the matches are provided in separate tabs.
            The <strong>reset</strong> button can be used when starting a new game.
          </p>
          <img src="results.png" alt="A sample view of results."/>

          <p>
            Statistics include the frequency of all letters and the frequency of each pair of letters in the word list.
            The frequency of all the letters and the pairs of letters are used as weights to generate a score for each match.
            Matches are sorted by score in the statistics tab.

      If you're regularly online - or just a lover of word games - there's a strong chance you've seen friends sharing a small colorful grid and discussing something named 'Wordle.' What is all the fuss about, you ask? We've got the answers!

      What is Wordle?
      Wordle is a simple online word game that challenges people to find a five-letter word in six guesses - with a new puzzle being published every day. As internet fads go, this one is universal, educational, and free! What's better is that Wordle is ad-free, too, with founder Josh Wardle promising to keep it so. The British software engineer simply wanted to create a fun and simple game for him and his partner to enjoy. After sharing his creation on the family WhatsApp group, the game's fan base grew at an unbelievable rate. Thanks to the likes of Reddit and Twitter, where people built fan communities and easily shared their scores, the user base jumped from 90 players on November 1 to 300,000+ by the start of 2022. 

      Considering some of the more baffling viral trends we've seen the past few years (we're looking at you cinnamon challenge), it's great to see a fun and free game become such a worldwide hit. If you're good with five-letter words, give it a go!

      How To Play Wordle
      Wordle is a game that's easy to play, and once you've figured out the tricks and tips, easy to win. Let's start with the basics of how to play Wordle.

      The aim of Wordle is to guess the correct five-letter word, so to begin, simply enter any five-letter word and look at the results.
      After entering your first word, the individual letters will be color-coded. Green means the letter and position of the letter are correct, yellow means the letter is correct, but the position is not, and gray means the letter is not in the five-letter word.
      Continue guessing five-letter words, and use the colors to inform your decisions. However, be careful; you only have six guesses to lock in the correct five-letter word!
      If you guess the correct word, congratulations; you've won. If you don't guess correctly, the correct five-letter word will be revealed to you after your sixth guess.
      The trickiest part of Wordle is having a good knowledge of five-letter words, something that we can all struggle with sometimes. To win Wordle, you will then need to think of specific letters within specific five-letter words - sound complicated? Well, you need a Wordle word finder. With Word Tips Wordle solver, you can use the refined search tools to find any five-letter word with any of the specific characters you need, and, more than that, you can exclude letters. If you want to win Wordle, this tool will be invaluable to you.

      Wordle Tips and Tricks
      For some people, word games can seem daunting and hard to get at first. If you are one of those people, don't stress! We've got a couple of tricks and tips to cheat Wordle and make sure you win every time. 

      Most Common Letters
      To solve Wordle as efficiently as possible, try words that include the letters e, t, a, i, o, n, s, h, and r; these are the most common letters in English. Another great trick is to begin with words that start with the letters t, a, o, d, and w; as again, these are the most common starting letters in English.

      Wordle Word Finder
      As we mentioned before, having a Wordle word finder to use like Word Tips can massively improve your game scores and help you enjoy Wordle even more. Need more five-letter words, or to sort through words with specific letters; our Wordle word finder's got you covered!

      Think Outside The Box

If you need more wordle help, we recommend getting yourself on a Wordle word finder and mastering the game of five-letter words first hand!
